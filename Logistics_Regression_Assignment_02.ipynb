    "\n",
    "*    **`Purpose` -**\n",
    "\n",
    "        * The performance of a machine learning model heavily relies on the values of its **hyperparameters**. These are parameters that control the learning process of the model itself, as opposed to the data points it learns from. \n",
    "        \n",
    "        * GridSearchCV aims to find the **optimal combination of hyperparameter values** that leads to the **best performance** on your specific dataset and problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "*    **`How it works` -**\n",
    "\n",
    "        1. **Define a grid of hyperparameters:** You specify a range of possible values for each hyperparameter you want to tune. This creates a \"grid\" of all possible combinations.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        2. **Cross-validation:** GridSearchCV uses a technique called **cross-validation** to evaluate different hyperparameter combinations. It splits the data into **folds** (usually k folds).\n",
    "        \n",
    "        3. **Iterate and evaluate:** For each hyperparameter combination in the grid:\n",

    "            * It evaluates the performance of the trained model on the **remaining fold** (the validation fold).\n",
    "    \n",
    "            * This process is repeated for all k folds, providing a more robust estimate of the model's performance for each hyperparameter combination.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        4. **Choose the best:** Finally, GridSearchCV selects the combination of hyperparameters that yielded the **best average performance** across all folds, according to the chosen scoring metric (e.g., accuracy, F1 score).\n",
